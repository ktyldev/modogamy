chasing cars
cuddles
shiny objects
treats
pooping
watching tv
long walks by the beach
swimming
eating
listening to music
travelling
drinking from the forbidden fountain
snow
dressing smart
fluffing up sofa cushions
being a good boy
proving flat earth
anime
bathing in the blood of my enemies
crossfit
meditating
singing
yelling at the birds
time is that it is not a blade, it stops for whom
dabbing on the haters
